# CLAUDE.md

## Language

This is a Go project. Use idiomatic Go conventions throughout.

## Error Handling

**Every error must be explicitly handled. No exceptions.**

- Never use `_` to discard an error value. Every `error` return must be checked.
- Return errors to the caller with added context using `fmt.Errorf("doing thing: %w", err)`.
- Use `%w` (not `%v`) when wrapping errors to preserve the error chain for `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
- Only log-and-return at the top-level boundary (e.g., `main`, HTTP handler). Everywhere else, propagate.
- Do not use `log.Fatal` or `os.Exit` outside of `main`.
- When multiple cleanup steps can each fail, handle every error individually rather than silently ignoring any of them.

## Code Style

- Follow standard `gofmt` / `goimports` formatting.
- Use the stdlib and standard patterns before reaching for third-party dependencies.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
- Prefer returning early over deeply nested `if/else` blocks.
- Use named return values sparingly, and only when they genuinely improve readability.

## Naming

- Use `MixedCaps` / `mixedCaps`, never underscores in Go names.
- Acronyms should be all-caps (`HTTP`, `ID`, `URL`), not `Http`, `Id`, `Url`.
- Package names are lowercase, single-word where possible. No `_` or `mixedCaps`.
- Interface names should not have an `I` prefix. Use the `-er` convention when it fits (`Reader`, `Closer`).

## Project Structure

- Keep `main.go` in the project root or under `cmd/<binary-name>/`.
- Group related code into packages by domain, not by type (avoid generic `models/`, `utils/` packages).
- Tests live alongside the code they test (`foo_test.go` next to `foo.go`).

## Testing

- Write table-driven tests where there are multiple cases for the same logic.
- Use `t.Helper()` in test helper functions so failure output points to the caller.
- Use `t.Parallel()` for tests that are safe to run concurrently.
- Assert errors explicitly in tests too: check that errors are returned when expected and that they wrap correctly.

## Dependencies

- Run `go mod tidy` after adding or removing imports.
- Vet new dependencies carefully. Prefer well-maintained, widely-used libraries.

## Tools

Tools are defined in `internal/tool/`. Each tool implements the `Tool` interface:

- `Name()` — unique identifier used in LLM tool calls
- `Description()` — explains to the LLM when/how to use the tool
- `InputSchema()` — JSON schema for input validation
- `Execute()` — performs the action and returns a `Result`
- `Category()` — determines parallel execution behavior (`CategoryRead` vs `CategoryWrite`)

When adding a new tool:
1. Create `<toolname>.go` with the implementation
2. Add corresponding `<toolname>_test.go` with table-driven tests
3. Register the tool in `cmd/root.go`
4. Prefer `git` tool for structured git operations over raw `bash` calls

## LSP Integration

The `internal/lsp/` package provides Language Server Protocol support:

- `Registry` — tracks available language servers and their configurations
- `Manager` — manages server lifecycle and client connections
- `Client` — communicates with a running language server

Language servers are detected automatically at startup via `DetectAvailable()`.

## Context Management

The `internal/context/` package handles context window limits:

- Token counting tracks usage against model limits
- Automatic summarization using Claude Haiku when approaching limits
- Recent messages preserved for continuity

## Agent Architecture

The core loop lives in `internal/agent/`:

1. Build request with conversation history and available tools
2. Stream response, handling text and tool calls
3. Execute tools (parallel for reads, sequential for writes)
4. Feed results back and continue until done or compaction needed
